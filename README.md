# DOM Playground

A tiny vanilla JavaScript project to experiment with DOM manipulation.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page to open in a browser
- `styles.css` — minimal styling, includes a dark theme
- `app.js` — event handlers and examples (add/remove items, filter/search, counter, theme toggle, log)

How to use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use `file://` path).
2. Try adding items, removing them, use the search box to filter, and toggle theme.
3. Check the Live DOM Log for actions and timestamped messages.

Notes
- This is plain HTML/CSS/JS — no build step required.
- Intended for quick experimentation with querySelector, event delegation, and DOM methods.

Ideas to extend
- Persist items to localStorage
- Add editing of items
- Add keyboard navigation and accessible labels
